This program solved a Rubik's Cube Layer by Layer. It was a very rudimentary program that I wrote several years ago before I became the coder that I am today.

Possible improvements:
*Comments! (I don't understand all of what is going on in here after a few years, so it needs more comments.)
*Object Oriented?
*Functionalizing so it is more readable.
